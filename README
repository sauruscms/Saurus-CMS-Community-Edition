SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
---------------------
Minimum requirements for running Saurus CMS on your server:

1. Web Server Software: Apache.
2. Program language: PHP 5 until 5.3.x.
3. Database: MySQL 4.x until 5.0.51.


INSTALLATION
--------------

Linux (using shell access)
--------------------------

1. Make sure you have Apache web server, PHP and MySQL installed before you continue. 

2. Open the web browser and go to the URL of the website, eg.: 
	
	http://www.yoursite.com/install.php

	Main installation script will install the database and the config.php file will be adjusted with the required database access variables.

or use the command line option:

	php install.php -h<database hostname> -u<database username> -p<database password> -d<database name> -U<cms username> -P<cms password> -H<url of your site>
	
3. Make sure that the following directories have write permissions by the web server:

	public/ - upload folder, public folder and subfolders are accessible to everyone.
	shared/ - upload folder, shared folder and subfolders have limited access depending on given permissions. 
	extensions/ - for uploading Saurus 4 extensions. 
	classes/smarty/templates - Saurus API templates
	classes/smarty/templates_c - Saurus API compiled templates code


Installation using only FTP access
----------------------------------

1. Use binary mode (not ascii mode!) for file transfer and upload CMS files to the root folder of your website using FTP.

2. Set up temporary read & write permission for everybody (666) for following files using the FTP program:

	config.php

3. Run web-based installation script:

	http://www.yoursite.com/install.php

4. Change file permissions back to normal: read & write for the owner, read for everybody (644):

	config.php

5. Make sure that the following directories have write permissions by the web server:

	public/ - upload folder, public folder and subfolders are accessible to everyone.
	shared/ - upload folder, shared folder and subfolders have limited access depending on given permissions.
